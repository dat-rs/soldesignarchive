Sebastião Rodrigues (1929–1997) was a Portuguese graphic designer.

He was born in 1929 in Dafundo, Lisbon, Portugal.

From a very young age, and through his father, who worked at the newspaper A Voz, he started doing odd small jobs for the advertising department.

In 1940-41, he studied at the Escola Industrial Marquês de Pombal, where he had as teachers the painter <a class="text-cat-link author" href="/authors/Calvet de Magalhães/">Calvet de Magalhães</a> and the architect Frederico George. Financial difficulties would force him to abandon his studies.

In 1945 he started working at Atelier de Publicidade Artística (APA).

In 1948 he started working at the studio of Manuel Rodrigues.

In 1959, with a grant from <a class="text-cat-link publisher" href="/publishers/Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian/">Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian</a>, he travelled through northern Portugal for six months, collecting and researching popular and vernacular graphic materials and motifs.

Between 1959 and 1961, he art-directed the short-lived <a class="text-cat-link tag" href="/tags/Almanaque/">Almanaque</a> magazine, an innovative title in the Portuguese publishing landscape.

In the sixties, he started working with Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian. He designed dozens of posters, exhibition catalogues, and printed ephemera.

He designed hundreds of covers and jackets for the Portuguese publishers <a class="text-cat-link publisher" href="/publishers/Ulisseia/">Ulisseia</a>, <a class="text-cat-link publisher" href="/publishers/Publicações Europa-América/">Publicações Europa-América</a>, <a class="text-cat-link publisher" href="/publishers/Sá da Costa/">Sá da Costa</a>, Verbo, <a class="text-cat-link publisher" href="/publishers/Arcádia/">Arcádia</a>, and others.

He worked with the Estado Novo regime throughout his career, namely through Secretariado Nacional de Informação, the government’s propaganda arm.

Notable clients include RTP, Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Banco de Portugal, and Mosteiro da Batalha.

In 1991 he won ICOGRADA’s Award of Excellence.
