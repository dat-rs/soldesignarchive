            <p class="faq-text">
            We’d love to take in all your old printed matter, but storage space is limited. If you have cool stuff that you think would find a good home at Sol please reach out with some photos, and we’ll go from there!

            <h2 class="title about">How are artifacts imaged?</h2>
            <p class="faq-text">
            Most images are obtained by scanning the objects on a flatbed scanner. It’s a great way to get good quality, evenly lit images of printed matter. Things obviously get more complicated with larger formats, which is why, for now, most of the artifacts online are small-format stuff. If some anonymous benefactor would like to donate a large-format scanner, we’d looove one!
