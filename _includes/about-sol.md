Sol Design Archive is an online collection of stuff with a focus on 20th century Portuguese graphic design and illustration but a voracious appetite for the full breadth of visual expression. The online archive currently features <strong>{{ published_artifacts.size }}</strong> artifacts by <strong>{{ published_authors.size }}</strong> authors. Made for fun, out of love and to share by Ricardo Santos.
