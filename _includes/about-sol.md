<p class="about-sol">
Sol Design Archive is an online archive of design with a special focus on nineteenth-century Portuguese graphic design and illustration but a voracious appetite for the full breadth of visual expression. The online archive currently contains <strong>{{ site.artifacts.size }}</strong> artifacts by <strong>{{ site.authors.size }}</strong> authors. Collected, maintained and designed by Ricardo Santos out of love for these shapes and colors.
