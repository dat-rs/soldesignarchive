The Peculiar Manicule is an archive of graphic design collected and maintained by an anonymous Seattle designer. It features graphic design, illustration and typography from the 1960s and 1970s and is filled with bright saturated colours, whimsical illustrations and the full spectrum of typographical expression. This archive is overflowing with eye candy.

The archive is divided into five categories: Books, Ephemera, Typography, Playthings, and Hallmark Psychedelia. Please go check it out now!
