Reading got me into books and books got me into design and illustration. In a way, they’re the reason I became a graphic designer.

<h4>Backstory</h4>

I’ve been collecting old books and printed ephemera for a bunch of years. My favorite spot to look for books is Feira da Ladra, the biggest and oldest flea market in Lisbon. When I was in college, more often than not I’d skip Tuesday morning’s classes to go there. I loved that ritual so much. It was always a thrill: exploring the city and the infinite archives of old shit that all those people would bring together in a single place. I’d sometimes take the subway to Santa Apolónia and start at the bottom of the feira; sometimes I walked or hopped on the 28 tram to Voz do Operário, crossing Alfama, and started at the top, next to São Vicente de Fora. Sometimes I’d go with friends but almost always by myself.
