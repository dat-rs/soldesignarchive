Reading got me into books and books got me into design and illustration. In a way, they’re the reason I became a graphic designer.

Backstory

I’ve been collecting old books and printed ephemera for a bunch of years. My favorite spot to look for books is Feira da Ladra, the biggest and oldest flea market in Lisbon. When I was in college, more often than not I’d skip Tuesday morning’s classes to go there. I loved that ritual so much. It was always a thrill: exploring the city and the infinite archives of old shit that all those people would bring together in a single place. I’d sometimes take the subway to Santa Apolónia and start at the bottom of the feira; sometimes I walked or hopped on the 28 tram to Voz do Operário, crossing Alfama, and started at the top, next to São Vicente de Fora. Sometimes I’d go with friends but almost always by myself. 

Some of the fondest memories include squatting for endless minutes under the blazing sun while rummaging through piles of thousands of books labeled «everything 0,50€», talking and listening to the sellers about their areas of expertise, bargaining for the prices, that one time I accidentally got drunk before noon when trying to get change for a 20€ bill, walking up and down the hills looking for a functioning atm.

During these times I became familiar with the book cover work of some of the greatest mid-century Portuguese designers and illustrators. The work of Sebastião Rodrigues, Paulo-Guilherme, Victor Palla, João da Câmara Leme, António Garcia, Tóssan, Bernardo Marques, etc., would pop up every week. I started checking who designed the covers, associating them with specific publishers, imprints and collections, looking up information online. At that time I was really interested in the world of books and publishing. 

I had always loved to read since I was a child. Not just books, magazines or newspapers: to this day I can get lost in a pamphlet about plumbing or in a dry, technical paper about something very specific of which I know nothing about. When I went to college I started reading more and more and learning about literature and the history of the book and publishing.

I also began to fall in love with the visual side of books. Those covers were exciting, graphic, witty, expressive. They were fun. It seemed impossible to me that there was a time, not so long ago, where book covers could be like that. The contemporary Portuguese book cover landscape had been taken over by the bland, mainstream, lowest common denominator advertising logic. Almost everything was photographic, generic, gloss finished and in all honesty poorly designed. (A few exceptions burned bright — Tinta-da-China and Antígona are two independent publishers which have militantly placed great care and emphasis on design). But these Ladra covers showed me the possibilities and richness of visual expression.

I started collecting them. I did more research. I combed through catalogues for the publishers and imprints, bought old industry periodicals to look through the ads that listed the books published in each collection. I went to the Hemeroteca looking for old literature journals and periodicals. I became particularly fascinated by the early numbers of Os Livros das Três Abelhas, an imprint which in the fifties started publishing cheap paperback editions of contemporary works. 

A drawn out birth

As I started learning and practising design I realized I should somehow publish my humble but growing collection. XIX century Portuguese graphic design and illustration are virtually unknown and I bet the internet would love to see these. I could maybe help fellow designers, researchers, students.

My first attempt was a tumblr. Then I started an Instagram account. A year and a half  ago I decided that I needed a full wordpress hosted site to house the archive, so I learned php and started to designed and built the site. That megalomanous enterprise eventually became overwhelming and got pushed to the side. Earlier this year I gave it another go with Webflow databases but again it got too complex to muster up the energy to launch.

And then I remembered Jekyll. I’d learnt about it when I transferred my site to github pages. After some research I realized I could build a site with the organization I wanted (the ability to browse by author, year, type, etc.) while keeping it simple and free. And here we are.

Finally launching

rsda is launching with mostly book covers by Portuguese designers and illlustrators. Book covers are by far the easiest artifacts of which to produce quality images — just throw them in the scanner.
