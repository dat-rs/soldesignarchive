Almanaque was a Portuguese magazine published between October 1959 and May 1961. It was directed by <a class="text-cat-link tag" href="/tags/Joaquim%20Figueiredo%20Magalh達es/">Joaquim Figueiredo Magalh達es</a> and art directed by <a class="text-cat-link author" href="/authors/Sebasti達o%20Rodrigues/">Sebasti達o Rodrigues</a>, who took the worn-out formula of the almanac and devised a creative and boundary-pushing publication both in content and design. The 18 numbers published are some of the best graphic design produced in Portugal in the twentieth century.
